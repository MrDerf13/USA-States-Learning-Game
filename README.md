# USA States Learning Tool

- A Turtle Graphics App that displays a map of the USA and let's you test your knowledge of the states of the USA!

## Usage Notes

- Run code
- An input window will allow you to type in a state name
- Input is case insensitively checked against data in CSV files
- If it is a valid state name Turtle Graphics will display it over the state on the map
- Click cancel or close to end the app, states that you didn't get will be saved in the "states_to_learn.csv"

## Yet to implement:

- better user feedback on all inputs, correct, incorrect, invalid
- a review once you've ended the run to show the user the data from the states_to_learn.csv
